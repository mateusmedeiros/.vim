This is a repository with my .vim directory. I think that the only file useful for other people here is .vimrc, but who knows?

```bash
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mateusmedeiros/vim-config.git .vim
ln -s .vim/.vimrc .vimrc
```

YouCompleteMe probably won't work out-of-the-box because it's installation is a pain and it has a compiled component. https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe
